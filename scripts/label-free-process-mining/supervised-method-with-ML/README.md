# Overview

A supervised machine learning based approach of process discovery without labels

# Code

- `feature_extraction.py`: a series of functions for feature extraction
- `evaluation`: functions for building a classifier and evaluating the proposed method

# Usage

- Download process mining datasets with `../../dataset_downloader.py`
- Edit the main function of `evaluation.py`
- Run `python evaluation.py`

# Notes

- The random forest is used for a classifier
